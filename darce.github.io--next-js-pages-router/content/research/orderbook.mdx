## What is an Order Book?

In a marketplace, some market participantswant to **buy**, and others want to **sell**. An order book is a list that organizes all these intentions in one place.

Every financial market uses an order book to match buyers with sellers.

## See It In Action

Below is a **live order book** from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The numbers are updated in real-time as traders place buy and sell orders.

## The Two Sides of Every Trade

### 🟢 Bids: The Buyers

On one side, you have **buyers**. They submit "bids"—the prices they're willing to pay. Think of it like an auction: buyers compete by offering higher prices.

> *"I'll buy 0.5 Bitcoin for $103,000"*

The highest bid is called the **best bid**. It represents the most someone is currently willing to pay.

### 🔴 Asks: The Sellers

On the other side, you have **sellers**. They submit "asks"—the prices at which they're willing to sell. Sellers compete by offering lower prices.

> *"I'll sell 0.3 Bitcoin for $103,050"*

The lowest ask is called the **best ask**. It represents the cheapest price at which someone is willing to sell right now.

## Key Concepts to Notice

### The Spread

Look at the gap between the **best bid** (highest buy offer) and the **best ask** (lowest sell offer). This gap is called the **spread**.

- A **small spread** means buyers and sellers mostly agree on price—the market is "liquid"
- A **large spread** means there's more disagreement—it costs more to trade immediately

### Order Imbalance

The **order imbalance** tells you whether there's more buying or selling pressure:

- **Positive imbalance** (more bids than asks): More buyers are waiting—prices might rise
- **Negative imbalance** (more asks than bids): More sellers are waiting—prices might fall

### Market Depth

The colored bars show **how much** people want to buy or sell at each price level. Longer bars mean more volume. This is called "depth"—it shows how much the price would move if a large order came in.

## How Trades Happen

A trade occurs when a buyer's bid **matches** a seller's ask:

1. **Market order**: *"I want to buy right now at whatever price is available"* — This instantly takes the best ask
2. **Limit order**: *"I want to buy, but only at $103,000 or less"* — This sits in the order book waiting

When someone places a market buy order, they "lift" the lowest ask. When someone market sells, they "hit" the highest bid. The order book updates instantly.

---

## Why This Matters

Understanding order books helps you:

- **Time your trades better** — See if there's support (lots of bids) or resistance (lots of asks) at certain prices
- **Estimate trading costs** — The spread is essentially a fee you pay for immediacy
- **Gauge market sentiment** — Order imbalance hints at short-term price direction

## Try It Yourself

Use the dropdown above to switch between different cryptocurrency pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) and observe how each market behaves differently. Some are calmer, some are more volatile—you can see it in the order book.
