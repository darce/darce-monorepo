## What is an Order Book?

In a marketplace, some market participants want to **buy**, and others want to **sell**. An order book is the _data structure_ that records those intentions: all active buy and sell orders, grouped by price.

Below is a **live limit order book** from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. React and TypeScript handle rendering. Data fetching is done with a WebSocket connection. The data updates in real time as new orders arrive and old ones are filled or cancelled.

## The Two Sides of Every Trade

### 🟢 Bids: (Buy Side)

**Bids** are prices at which traders are willing to buy.

> “Buy 0.5 BTC at 93,000 USDT”

The **best bid** is the highest buy price currently in the book. It defines the top of the bid side.

### 🔴 Asks: (Sell Side)

**Asks** are prices at which traders are willing to sell.

> “Sell 0.3 BTC at 93,050 USDT”

The **best ask** is the lowest sell price currently in the book. It defines the top of the ask side.

Together, best bid and best ask define the **top of book**.

## Key Structures to Watch

### Spread

The **spread** is:

> spread = best ask − best bid

- Narrow spread → buyers and sellers mostly agree on price; the market is liquid.  
- Wide spread → less agreement; it is more expensive to trade immediately.

### Order Imbalance

**Order imbalance** describes the relative weight of bids vs asks at or near the current price:

- More bid volume than ask volume → buying pressure; upward bias.  
- More ask volume than bid volume → selling pressure; downward bias.

You can think of this as a snapshot of who is “waiting in line” to trade.

### Market Depth

The colored bars aggregate **volume at each price level**. Longer bars mean more resting size at that price.

Depth tells you:

- How far price might move if a large market order hits the book  
- Where size is concentrated (potential support/resistance zones)

## How Trades Execute

A trade occurs when a buy order and a sell order cross.

Two basic order types:

1. **Market order**  
   - “Buy now, whatever the best available price is.”  
   - Matches immediately against the best prices on the opposite side.  
   - Consumes liquidity.

2. **Limit order**  
   - “Buy at 93,000 or better (lower).”  
   - Sits in the book until matched or cancelled.  
   - Provides liquidity.

When a market buy arrives, it lifts the lowest ask.  
When a market sell arrives, it hits the highest bid.  
Each match removes volume from those levels and the book updates.
