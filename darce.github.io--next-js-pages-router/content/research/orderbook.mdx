## Overview

This research prototype demonstrates real-time cryptocurrency order book data retrieval and visualization using the CoinAPI cryptocurrency API.

### Features

- **Order Book Depth Visualization**: Visual representation of buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders at different price levels
- **Market Spread**: Real-time calculation of the difference between best bid and best ask prices
- **Order Imbalance**: Analysis of the disparity between total bid and ask volumes
- **Significant Price Levels**: Identification of price levels with substantial order volumes

### How It Works

The application fetches real-time order book data from the CoinAPI REST endpoint, which provides:
- Current bid orders (buyers willing to purchase)
- Current ask orders (sellers willing to sell)
- Price and size for each order level

This data is then analyzed to compute key trading metrics and displayed in an interactive visualization.
