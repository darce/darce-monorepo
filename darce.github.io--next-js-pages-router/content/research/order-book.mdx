## What is an Order Book?

In a marketplace, some market participants want to **buy**, and others want to **sell**. An order book is the _data structure_ that records those intentions: all active buy and sell orders, grouped by price.

Below is a **live limit order book** from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. React and TypeScript handle rendering. Data fetching is done with a WebSocket connection. The data updates in real time as new orders arrive and old ones are filled or cancelled.

## The Two Sides of Every Trade

### 🟢 Bids: (Buy Side)
<BestBid />
**Bids** are prices at which traders are willing to buy.

> "Buy 0.5 BTC at 93,000 USDT"

The **best bid** is the highest buy price currently in the book. It defines the top of the bid side.

### 🔴 Asks: (Sell Side)
<BestAsk />
**Asks** are prices at which traders are willing to sell.

> "Sell 0.3 BTC at 93,050 USDT"

The **best ask** is the lowest sell price currently in the book. It defines the top of the ask side.

Together, best bid and best ask define the **top of book**.

## Key Structures to Watch

### Order Imbalance
<OrderImbalance />
**Order imbalance** tells you who's winning: buyers or sellers.

- More buyers waiting → price might go up  
- More sellers waiting → price might go down

#### Where Does Volume Come From?

Every order in the book has a **size**, how many units someone wants to buy or sell at that price.

For example, Binance might send:

```json
{
  "bids": [["2.35", "1500"], ["2.34", "800"]],
  "asks": [["2.36", "1200"], ["2.37", "600"]]
}
```

Reading this: "Someone wants to buy 1,500 units at \$2.35" and "Someone wants to sell 1,200 units at \$2.36."

**Total volume** is just adding up all the sizes on each side:

- Bids: 1,500 + 800 = **2,300 total**
- Asks: 1,200 + 600 = **1,800 total**

```typescript
const totalBidVolume = bids.reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.size, 0)
const totalAskVolume = asks.reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.size, 0)
```

#### How Imbalance Is Calculated

The formula compares how much is on each side:

> **Order Imbalance** = (Bid Volume − Ask Volume) ÷ (Bid Volume + Ask Volume)

In plain English: **subtract the two sides, then divide by the total.**

```typescript
const orderImbalance = (totalBidVolume - totalAskVolume) / (totalBidVolume + totalAskVolume)
```

This gives a number between -1 and +1:

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **+1** | All buyers, no sellers |
| **+0.5** | Buyers outnumber sellers 3 to 1 |
| **0** | Perfectly balanced |
| **-0.5** | Sellers outnumber buyers 3 to 1 |
| **-1** | All sellers, no buyers |

#### A Simple Example

Using the numbers above (bids = 2,300, asks = 1,800):

$$\frac{2300 - 1800}{2300 + 1800} = \frac{500}{4100} = 0.12$$

That's **+12%** slightly more buyers than sellers. The book leans toward buying pressure.

### Spread
<Spread />

The **spread** is the gap between the best ask and the best bid:

> Spread = Best Ask − Best Bid

The live value above shows the current spread for the selected trading pair.

- **Narrow spread** → buyers and sellers mostly agree on price; the market is liquid.  
- **Wide spread** → less agreement; it costs more to trade immediately.

### Market Depth

The colored bars aggregate **volume at each price level**. Longer bars mean more resting size at that price.

Depth tells you:

- How far price might move if a large market order hits the book  
- Where size is concentrated (potential support/resistance zones)

## How Trades Execute

A trade occurs when a buy order and a sell order cross.

Two basic order types:

1. **Market order**  
   - “Buy now, whatever the best available price is.”  
   - Matches immediately against the best prices on the opposite side.  
   - Consumes liquidity.

2. **Limit order**  
   - “Buy at 93,000 or better (lower).”  
   - Sits in the book until matched or cancelled.  
   - Provides liquidity.

When a market buy arrives, it lifts the lowest ask.  
When a market sell arrives, it hits the highest bid.  
Each match removes volume from those levels and the book updates.
